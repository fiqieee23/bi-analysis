# üìä Business Intelligence Analysis Projects

This repository contains Business Intelligence (BI) projects using Python for classification modeling and data visualization. The goal is to analyze real-world datasets and predict outcomes using machine learning techniques.

These projects were created for academic purposes and can be used as templates for your own BI-related analysis.

### 1. üßæ Customer Churn Analysis

- **Objective**: Predict customer churn for a telecommunications company based on customer behavior and service usage.
- **Techniques**:
  - Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM
  - One-hot encoding, feature scaling, train-test split
  - Visual analysis of churn patterns (e.g., by contract type and tenure)
- **Input**: Telco churn dataset (`telco-churn-filtered.xlsx`)

### 2. ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction

- **Objective**: Predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health records and lifestyle factors.
- **Techniques**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Feature mapping (e.g. age categories), scaling, model evaluation
  - Visualization of class distribution and ROC curve
- **Input**: Heart disease dataset (`HeartDiseasePredictionCleaned.xlsx`)

## üß∞ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## üèÅ Getting Started

1. **Install the required libraries** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
2. **Replace dataset file paths** with your own .xlsx file locations in the scripts:
df = pd.read_excel("your_path_here.xlsx")
3. **Run the script or Jupyter Notebook** to perform analysis and see the results.
